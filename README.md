# Space Focus

This is a small project to have an outter-space living quarters to look at while
working, along with engine sounds.  I was going to try to load the myNoise.net
white noise generator in an iframe, but their headers are preventing that from
happening.  So, for now, there is just a link to open the engine sounds in a new
tab.

I came up with this idea because my friends and I enjoy using the spaceship
engine sounds videos on YT, while coding, but I wanted to come up with a solution
to achieve the same thing without needed to waste so much data and bandwith,
streaming it.

I found a code example for the spinning planet written in HTML/CSS/JS, found here:

The actual codepen is here:

The myNosie.net white noise generator, with my sound settings, found here:
